      <p><i><b>Everyone: </b></i></p>
      <p>On the first day, we took some time to learn about the Wumpus challenge. We reviewed the rule book, broke off into groups, and took inventory of our Lego Mindstorm materials. We also assigned the roles of our team. For coding the robot we have Erin and Gaby. Our builders are Joey, Lizzie, and Ralph. For web development, we have Gaby, Lizzie, and Ralph. Our logisticians were Lizzie, Erin, and Joey.</p>
      <p><i><b>Coders:</b></i></p>
        <p> Our coders spent their time downloading all necessary software for challenge</p>
      <p><i><b>Builders:</b></i></p>
        <p> Our builders began assembling the robot. They attached both of the motors and the wheels and built a castor for the robot to use for turning. </p>

      <h3><b>DAY TWO</b></h3>
      <h5>It's Aliiiive, <span class="w3-opacity">November 18, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><i><b>Everyone: </b></i></p>
      <p>Today we created a google doc to record and share all of our work. We then organized the google doc by roles.  </p>
      <p><i><b>Coders:</b></i></p>
        <p> Our coders spent their time woking on the basic movement. This led to Baby's first words and first steps!</p>
      <p><i><b>Builders:</b></i></p>
        <p> The builders first replaced the previous castor with a new castor. The new castor is a metal ball that allows for unlimited degrees of rotation for turning. This was an improvement from the previous castor which had limited movement. The builders also attached a light sensor to control robotic motion and arranged them so that the ports weren’t blocked. </p>
       <p><i><b>Web Designers:</b></i></p>
        <p> The web developers began to organize what will be included on the website. They also created the basic framework for all the pages on the website. </p> 
       <p><i><b>Logisticians:</b></i></p>
        <p> The logic team created a diagram to evaluate the logic used in the navigation task. They went through various Wumpus Worlds in the Wumpus World Simulator in order to determine the logic for our algorithm.  </p>

      <h3><b>DAY THREE</b></h3>
      <h5>The Battle Begins, <span class="w3-opacity">November 21, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><i><b>Coders:</b></i></p>
        <p> We continued to work on the movement of the robot, trying to base the movement on the sensors. We worked to get the robot to stop in the center of the black squares and recognize when it was passing across white lines. </p>
      <p><i><b>Builders:</b></i></p>
        <p> The builders did movement tests to determine the stability of the structure. </p>
       <p><i><b>Web Designers:</b></i></p>
        <p> The web design team took photos for the website </p> 
       <p><i><b>Logisticians:</b></i></p>
        <p> The logic team wrote out the algorithm using if-then statements to determine which steps to take. They tested the algorithm rigorously with wumpus world simulations and established instructions about how robot reacts to stimuli, but struggled with how to determine safe/danger zones. </p> 
        <p><i><b>Weaponry: </b></i></p>
      <p>Joey was appointed our Secretary of War and began work on a weaponry system.   </p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><i><b>Coders:</b></i></p>
        <p> Worked on finishing touches to the logic code to ensure that the robot would avoid dangerous spaces. Used the logic that if space was marked as a possibly danger zone twice, it was definitely dangerous </p>
      <p><i><b>Weapons Team:</b></i></p>
        <p> More testing and videotaping the robot shoot a “mock Wumpus”. </p>
       <p><i><b>Web Designers:</b></i></p>
        <p> Added photos and videos documenting the robot build and team collaboration. Input portions of robot build and consciousness reflections. </p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p><i><b>Coders:</b></i></p>
        <p>We worked on getting robots to move and applying logic code to the movement code, and worked on documenting pseudocode for the robot code that is easier for people to read. </p>
       <p><i><b>Web Designers:</b></i></p>
        <p> The web developers continued to work on the code and build of the website. </p> 
       <p><i><b>Logisticians:</b></i></p>
        <p> The logic team Worked on logic reflection. Used the pseudocode and made it a more verbose description of the logic.  </p>
